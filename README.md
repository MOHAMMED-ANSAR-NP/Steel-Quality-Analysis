# Steel-Quality-Analysis
The best grade of steel is predicted using analyzing its composition. Nickel (Ni), Carbon (C), Phosphorus (P), Manganese (Mn), Silicon (Si), Chromium (Cr), are the alloys of Stainless steel. This project is done to determine whether the given Stainless steel is good or not by analyzing the composition percentage of these alloys. We have a variety of steel compositions from which we are concluding whether the composition is good or not, using a classification dataset.
